I want to disable a function of the visual studio program but I donâ€™t know how to do it
this program function is monitor folders and extract files with keyword brands and classify them into destination folders

Destination Folder path (e.g.) C:\Users\user1\OneDrive\Tool Installer\Destination\L4 \ Monthly Folder (Auto create) \ Brand Folder (Auto create)
but now i want to remove or let it invalidate the monthly folder part (I know is which part need to change in visual studio)
below is i hope
Destination Folder path (e.g.) C:\Users\user1\OneDrive\Tool Installer\Destination\L4 \ Brand Folder (Auto create)
